#Phidget InterfaceKit Boards

The Phidget Manager library makes for an intuitive and easy way to manage your Phigets I/O devices. For a quick start into your Manager project see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-phidget-API/blob/master/docs/InterfaceKit.md#GettingStarted) section or jump to this [basic I/O example](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-phidget-API/blob/master/examples/InterfaceKit.js).

This module will work with all Phidget InterfaceKit I/O boards. Some boards like the relay and signal switching boards may not have inputs, triggers, or data rates, so these fields will be empty when connected to such boards.
