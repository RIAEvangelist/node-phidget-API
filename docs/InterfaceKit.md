#Phidget InterfaceKit Boards
This module will work with all Phidget InterfaceKit I/O boards. Some boards like the relay and signal switching boards may not have inputs, triggers, or data rates, so these fields will be empty when connected to such boards.

[Basic InterfacKit example](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-phidget-API/blob/master/examples/InterfaceKit.js)

ToDo : map out module and describe use
