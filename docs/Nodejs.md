# Node.js

## About


Node.js is an asynchronous event driven framework that provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API designed to optimize an application's throughput and scalability for real-time applications. It uses Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript.  

Node's non-blocking model makes for a perfect framework to use products like [Phidgets](http://www.phidgets.com/) where one may want many devices communicating and reporting changes without having to worry about other devices or processes blocking the flow thus allowing for real-time, dynamic applications.

## Installation
It is advisory to have the latest version of Node.js for best performance of this API.

Node.Js is available on all platforms including both 64 and 32 bit architecture:


1. [Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/)
